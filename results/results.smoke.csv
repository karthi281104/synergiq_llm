ours,0a21fd127fcc6c58,eval/pdfs/ALGORTIHM-SHORT-NOTES-_compressed.pdf,List 5 key concepts covered.,,"1. Time complexity: O(nlogn) or O(n) or O(log n) for various algorithms and problems, such as merge sort, closest pair of points, convex hull, knapsack problem, and activity selection problem. [p8:c16] [p11:c21] [p7:c13]
2. Space complexity: O(n) or O(log n) for merge sort, closest pair of points, and convex hull. [p8:c16]
3. Divide and conquer (DAC) algorithm: a technique that divides a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them recursively, and combines the solutions. [p7:c13]
4. DFS (Depth-First Search) traversal: a graph traversal technique used in both undirected and directed graphs, with specific edge types and node states. [p16:c34]
5. Asymptotic notation: a way to express the running time of algorithms, with examples of functions that do not satisfy the trichotomy property. [p3:c3]",0.0,0.0,1,,1.0,1.0,1,8.9047
