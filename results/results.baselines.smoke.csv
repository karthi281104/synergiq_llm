Artificial Intelligence (AI): The simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans, with the ability to perform tasks, reason, and make decisions. 

2. Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed.

rag_mmr,0a21fd127fcc6c58,eval/pdfs/public/ALGORTIHM-SHORT-NOTES-_compressed.pdf,List 5 key concepts covered.,,"Here are five key concepts covered in the provided context:

1. Time Complexity: The time required for an algorithm to execute, often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(nlogn) or O(n^2).

2. Space Complexity: The amount of memory or space utilized by an algorithm during its execution, also denoted by Big O notation, e.g., O(n) or O(logn).

3. Merge Sort: An efficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(nlogn) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the merging process. It is stable and preferable for large array sizes.

4. Graph Traversal: Techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) are used to visit all nodes in a graph or tree in a specified order, processing information once. DFS can be applied to both undirected and directed graphs, leading to different types of edges (tree, forward, back, and cross edges).

5. Greedy Algorithm: A problem-solving approach that makes locally optimal choices at each step, aiming for a global optimum. Applications include job sequencing with deadlines and optimal merge patterns, with time complexities of O(nlogn) and O(n^2), respectively.",,,1,,0.0,1.0,1,13.6288
